The grep Command. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/

The grep command searches a particular file for a pattern of characters inputted. The command will display all of the lines that match this inputted pattern. grep stands for "global search for regular expression and print out".

grep -o command

The grep -o command prints out only the parts of the text file that match the inputted pattern line by line. It does not print out the entire matching line as the grep command does, but rather just the matching parts of the matching line.

grep -h command

The grep -h command displays the lines that match the pattern inputted, but it does not show the name of the file associated with the matched lines displayed.

grep -v command

The grep -v command does the opposite to the commands described above. This command instead prints out all of the lines that do not match the inputted pattern. 

grep -c command

Use the grep -c command in order to see the number of lines that match the inputted pattern. This command displays the number of lines that match the pattern.
